Data Science is multidiscipline, collect, observe, process data ... -> prediction and recommendation

Data is now explorion ( people, sensors, social ....)

Data visulization and data summerization are important because from data visualiszation and summerization, people can find out what kind of data is important. It is one of the first steps of data science.

What a data science need ? Statitic, mathematic, machine learning, optimization

In the “map” stage, a programming task is divided into a number of identical subtasks, which are then distributed across many processors
the intermediate results are then combined by a single reduce task



The most popular open source implementation of MapReduce is the Hadoop project

II.1 Statitic

1. Some concept
Population interet -> who is used for sampling ?

Data gerenartion process -> Create Data->Analyse->Ouput

Data generation process ( affect by assumption) if good assumption -> good data -> good ouput
if bad assumption -> bad data -> bad output ( revise)

Data are number in context (the meaning of data depend on individual-context)
Statitic makes observation on individual (ex M. A, M. B ) on a set of variable (ex. size, age..)

Type of variable 
  -categorical ex, gender, national... don't have arithmetic meaning
  -quantatif have arithmetic meaning ex age, size
  -ordinal don't have arithmetic meaning but have order ( How often you learn ? every day, somtime ...)
Statitics are:

Summezise of numerical data
not tell hold story
useful and meaningful

2. Display numerical data
For categorical variable, we can display by count, percentage (ex number of femme, number of homme), we call area principle (pie, line)
For quantatif variable, we can display by count, percentage (histogram usally for interval of value age (1-10), age (10-20))
